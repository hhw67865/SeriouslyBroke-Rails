# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing and Code Quality Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish a robust testing and code quality framework that includes complete test coverage, code style enforcement, and CI/CD integration to ensure high-quality standards throughout development.
# Details:
1. Set up comprehensive RSpec test suite:
   - Configure model tests with factories using FactoryBot
   - Implement controller tests for all API endpoints
   - Create system/feature tests using Capybara for critical user flows
   - Set up integration tests for complex interactions between components

2. Configure RuboCop for code style enforcement:
   - Create custom .rubocop.yml with project-specific rules
   - Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent non-compliant code
   - Configure auto-correction for common issues
   - Add documentation requirements for public methods

3. Implement test coverage monitoring:
   - Set up SimpleCov for test coverage reporting
   - Configure minimum coverage thresholds (aim for 90%+)
   - Generate HTML reports for easy visualization
   - Track coverage trends over time

4. Configure CI/CD pipeline:
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Implement parallel test execution for faster feedback
   - Configure test database setup and teardown
   - Add performance benchmarking for critical paths

5. Integrate code quality tools:
   - Add Brakeman for security vulnerability scanning
   - Configure Rails Best Practices for code optimization
   - Set up database query analysis with Bullet
   - Implement memory profiling for performance-critical sections

6. Create development workflow enforcement:
   - Implement pull request templates with quality checklists
   - Configure branch protection rules requiring passing tests
   - Set up automated code review comments for quality issues
   - Create documentation for testing standards and practices

7. Implement test data management:
   - Create comprehensive fixtures and factories
   - Set up database cleaner for test isolation
   - Implement VCR for external API testing
   - Configure test environment variables and configuration

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify test suite completeness:
   - Run full test suite and ensure all tests pass
   - Check test coverage reports to confirm >90% coverage
   - Manually verify that all models, controllers, and key features have tests
   - Confirm edge cases and error conditions are tested

2. Validate code quality enforcement:
   - Run RuboCop against the entire codebase and verify compliance
   - Test pre-commit hooks by attempting to commit non-compliant code
   - Verify that documentation requirements are enforced
   - Check that code style is consistent across the project

3. Test CI/CD integration:
   - Push code changes that break tests and verify CI pipeline fails
   - Push code changes that pass tests and verify CI pipeline succeeds
   - Confirm that test reports are properly generated and accessible
   - Verify that parallel test execution works correctly

4. Validate security scanning:
   - Introduce a known security vulnerability and verify it's detected
   - Run Brakeman scan and confirm results are accurate
   - Test Rails Best Practices recommendations for validity
   - Verify Bullet correctly identifies N+1 query issues

5. Test development workflow:
   - Create a pull request and verify templates and checks work
   - Attempt to merge failing code and confirm it's prevented
   - Verify code review automation provides useful feedback
   - Confirm documentation is accessible and comprehensive

6. Performance testing:
   - Run benchmarks before and after implementation to measure impact
   - Verify memory profiling correctly identifies issues
   - Test database query optimization recommendations
   - Confirm that performance metrics are tracked in CI
