# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive test suite for all application functionality.
# Details:
1. Write model unit tests for all models
2. Create controller tests for all endpoints
3. Implement system tests for key user flows
4. Add integration tests for complex interactions
5. Create performance tests for critical paths
6. Implement security tests (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
7. Add accessibility tests
8. Create test fixtures and factories
9. Implement continuous integration with GitHub Actions
