# Task ID: 2
# Title: Entries Management Table Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a professional table-based interface for entries management with filtering, sorting, and actions following the Categories items_list pattern.
# Details:
1. Create a new entries index view at `app/views/entries/index.html.erb` (COMPLETED)
2. Implement responsive table structure following Categories pattern (COMPLETED)
3. Create a partial for the entries table at `app/views/entries/_entries_table.html.erb` (COMPLETED)
4. Implement simplified sorting for amount and date columns only (asc/desc) (COMPLETED)
5. Add search functionality with dropdown selector (date, item, description, category)
6. Extract controller logic into methods/concerns for better organization
7. Create a reusable search concern for multiple controllers/models
8. Implement pagination using Pagy gem (version 6.0+)
9. Style table with consistent hover states and spacing
10. Add edit and delete actions with appropriate styling
11. Use SimpleForm with onchange submit for search functionality

# Test Strategy:
1. Test table rendering with various data sets
2. Verify filtering works correctly between All, Expenses, Income, and Savings
3. Test simplified sorting functionality for amount and date columns
4. Verify search functionality works with dropdown selector for different fields
5. Test pagination with large datasets
6. Verify edit and delete actions function correctly
7. Test responsive behavior on mobile devices
8. Verify reusable search concern works across different controllers
9. Test SimpleForm onchange submit behavior

### Details:
## COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

We significantly exceeded the original scope for Task 2 with extensive refactoring and UX improvements:

### Searchable System Architecture
- **Naming Conflict Resolution**: Resolved conflicts between model and controller concerns by renaming model concern to `ModelSearchable` and keeping controller concern as `Searchable`
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created `docs/searchable-system-reference.md` with complete system documentation for future reference
- **Helper Organization**: Moved search-specific helpers from ApplicationHelper to dedicated `SearchHelper` for better separation of concerns

### Professional UX Improvements  
- **Search Bar Styling**: Completely redesigned search bar to match the beautiful categories page design with integrated dropdown and search input
- **Form Utility Cleanup**: Removed `.form-input` utility class from custom.css and hardcoded all form styles for better maintainability
- **Currency Display**: Converted entry amounts to use Rails `number_to_currency` helper for proper currency formatting
- **Stimulus Controller**: Created proper `shared/search_placeholder_controller.js` to replace inline JavaScript

### Code Organization & Refactoring
- **Entry Partial Extraction**: Refactored table by extracting individual entry rows into `_entry.html.erb` partial
- **File Naming**: Renamed `_entries_table.html.erb` to `_table.html.erb` for cleaner organization since it's already in entries folder
- **Hardcoding Elimination**: Replaced repetitive case statements with centralized `entry_type_config` helper
- **Auto-Submit Fix**: Resolved dropdown auto-submit issues that were causing unwanted page reloads

### Technical Debt Cleanup
- **Server-Side Sorting**: Simplified complex JavaScript sorting to clean server-side implementation
- **Rails Conventions**: Ensured all code follows proper Rails conventions and patterns
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Created reusable, well-documented components following DRY principles

### Files Created/Modified:
**Created**: `app/models/concerns/model_searchable.rb`, `docs/searchable-system-reference.md`, `app/helpers/search_helper.rb`, `app/views/entries/_header.html.erb`, `app/javascript/controllers/shared/search_placeholder_controller.js`, `app/views/entries/_entry.html.erb`
