# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core data models and database schema with proper relationships and indexes.
# Details:
Create the following models with appropriate relationships and validations:
1. User: Authentication and profile information
2. Category: name, description, user_id, budget_amount
3. Entry: amount, date, description, category_id, user_id, entry_type (income/expense)
4. Item: name, description, price, category_id
5. Budget: name, amount, period_start, period_end, user_id
6. SavingsPool: name, target_amount, current_amount, deadline, user_id

Ensure proper indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns. Set up UUID primary keys for all models. Create database migrations and seed data for testing.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for all models verifying validations, associations, and business logic. Test database performance with benchmark tests for common queries. Verify proper normalization and referential integrity.
